## In a nutshell

The **Vote** contract is a governance contract. It's a smart contract that faciliates the decision-making process in a community. 
The most common usecase is within a DAO, where proposals are made and DAO-members cast their **vote**. DAO means Decentralised Autonomous Organization.
It's an entity that's made up of several smart contracts (on-chain). A DAO is often used by a dedicated community that needs an infrastructure to operate the organization.
A DAO has several components, but the most prominent component is the treasury, which is managed and used by the whole community.

## How it works

In order to allow members to vote, they need to hold a so-called `governance token`. A `governance token` is an ERC-20 token. 
The **Vote** contract needs an ERC-20 contract to function. With thirdweb you can also deploy your very own ERC-20 contract, the **Token** contract.
You can find more about the **Token** contract [here](/contracts/token).


## What can you do with our contract?

The following use cases are suited for the Vote contract:

1. You are working with a team and need to decide on organizational changes
2. Voting on managing and distributing funds in a treasury
3. Vote on any other proposal in an organization, such as a DAO.

## Setting up your Vote contract

You can create a **Vote** contract from the thirdweb dashboard. Go ahead and click on `Create new contract`.

The **Vote** contract can be found under Governance.

A **Vote** contract allows you to configure the following settings:
1. `Governance Token Address` is an ERC-20 contract to work with the **Vote** contract. This can be either our [Token](/contracts/token) or any other ERC-20 contract that implements IVotes interface.
2. `Proposal Token Threshold` is the amount of tokens a wallet should hold to make a proposal
3. `Voting Delay` is the time period after which members can vote on the proposal. This needs to be specified in numbers of blocks. As of now 6570 block is equal to 1 day. Depending on the blockchain you choose, this number might be different. For example as of now, Ethereum generates a block every approximately 14 seconds. Another chain might take more or less time to generate a block.
4. `Voting Period` is the period how long members can vote. Here the time period must also be defined in blocks.
5. `Voting Quorum` determines what the minimum percentage of votes are needed for the proposal to pass. This needs to be a number between 1 or 100.

Next you need to delegate the tokens in the `Governance Token Address` to the **Vote** contract, which basically authorising the vote contract for the tokens in the token contract.

That's it! Now you can make proposals using the **Vote** contract.
