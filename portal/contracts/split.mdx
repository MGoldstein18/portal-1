## In a nutshell

Introducing the split Contract, which lets you easily create royalty split to securely hold and distribute funds.
You can use it to store any funds by sending funds directly to the contract, plugging it in as the recipient address of other contracts, or any other way that you can send funds to a standard wallet.

## How it works

Think of the split contract as a fully customizable decentralized treasury. You can use the split contract to receive and send funds by interacting with other contracts. 
The split contract lets you specify (multiple) wallets who are recipients of any revenue or royalty split. Based on the split per wallet, the funds are distributed accordingly.
This contract also has the ability to hold native currencies (ETH and MATIC) and any ERC-20 tokens. 


## Setting up your split Contract

You can create and deploy a split contract from your dashboard. Go ahead and click on `Create new contract`.

Side note, you can also use the split contract in new NFT Collection contracts or Drop contracts.
Go to the settings inside your NFT Collection contract.

Enter the address of the split contract under either the `Primary Sales`, `Royalty recipient` or both.
Now in case of any sale, parties in the split contract will benefit from the primary sale. If you also entered the address of the split contract under `Royalty Recipient`, then the same goes for any subsequent sales.
