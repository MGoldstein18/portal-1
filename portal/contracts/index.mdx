## Create a Contract in thirdweb

With thirdweb you can mint NFTs, create drops and build your own marketplace. In this guide we'll deploy a contract on your thirdweb dashboard. 

### Select Contract

Pick any contract you want. In this tutorial we want to create a drop, so we need the 'Drop' contract for this.

### Customize Contract

Go ahead and fill in a name for this contract and optionally you can add a 'Royalty'.

### Confirm Transactions

You will be asked to confirm two transactions again to create the contract.
