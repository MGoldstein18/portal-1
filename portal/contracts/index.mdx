## Create a Contract in thirdweb project

With thirdweb you can mint NFT's, create drops and build your own marketplace. All of this is done inside Projects and Contracts. In this guide we'll deploy a contract on your thirdweb project. 

### Select Contract

Pick any contract you want. In this tutorial we want to create a drop, so we need the 'Drop' contract for this.

### Customize Contract

Go ahead and fill in a name for this contract and optionally you can add a 'Royalty'.

### Confirm Transactions

You will be asked to confirm two transactions again to create the contract.
