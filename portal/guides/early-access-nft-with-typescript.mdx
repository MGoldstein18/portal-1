## Introduction

In this guide, we are going to make our own early access NFTs using TypeScript. We are going to create an NFT using an edition drop and then we are going to set the price and the number of claimable NFTs. The edition drop allows us to create ERC1155 tokens which means that you can set up a collection of NFTs with a customizable number of each NFT. Once we create the NFT and the claim condition, we will display the NFT with connect wallet and claim buttons in a React project. 

## Let's begin

### 1. Create Edition Drop

Our first step is to create an edition drop. This can be done in the [dashboard](/dashboard) and if you aren't sure how to create the module please check [this guide.](/learn/introduction) 

### 2. Project Set-Up

Create a new React project with TypeScript and then install the dependencies:

- **@thirdweb-dev/sdk** - thirdweb TypeScript SDK.
- **ethers** - will give us very useful utils.
- **dotenv** - to hide our private key.
- **tslib** - utility package

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
npm install @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers dotenv
npm install --save-dev ts-node tslib
```

### 3. Instantiate the SDK

To create, configure and interact with our NFTs we will need to use the thirdweb SDK. Instead of initializing it each time we use it, let's make a function that initializes it and then can be called as needed. 

Start by making a new folder called `scripts` in the root of your project and then make a file in that folder called `getContract.ts`. 

In `getContract.ts` , follow these steps:

Import the libraries we'll need:

```tsx
// Importing libraries
import { ThirdwebSDK } from '@thirdweb-dev/sdk';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';


//Importing private key
dotenv.config();
```

Instantiate and connect to the contract using the contract address found in the dashboard. Then export the contract.

```tsx
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK(
  new ethers.Wallet(
    // Your wallet private key
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string,
    // RPC URL
    ethers.getDefaultProvider('https://rinkeby-light.eth.linkpool.io/')
  )
);
// Set variable for the edition drop contract address which can be found after creating an edition drop in the dashboard
const editionDropAddress = '<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>';
// Initialize the edition drop module with the contract address
const editionDrop = sdk.getEditionDrop(editionDropAddress)

export default editionDrop;
```

(PS: We're using the Rinkeby testnet in this guide)

### 4. Create the NFT

Now that we can connect to the SDK, we can move to the exciting step of creating our NFT! Make a new file in the `scripts` folder and call it `createNft.ts`. In this file we can follow these steps:

Import our module and the necessary library:

```tsx
import editionDrop from './getContract';
```

Use the `createBatch` method to create our NFT. This method allows for the creation of multiple NFTs but we are only going to create one for now.

```tsx
const createNFT = async () => {
  try {
    await editionDrop.createBatch([
      {
        name: 'Early Access',
        description: 'This NFT will give you early access!',
        // Get the NFT from a file in our project
        image: readFileSync('scripts/assets/earlyAccessNft.jpg'),
      },
    ]);
    console.log('✅ Successfully created a new NFT!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create the new NFT. Error: ', error);
  }
};

createNFT();

```

In your root directory, run the code with this command in your console: `npx ts-node scripts/createNft.ts`

And you should see the success message in your console:

![](/assets/portal/guides/early-access-nft-with-typescript/1-early-access-nft.png)

Awesome! We have our early access NFT☺️



PS: This is a TypeScript project. Don't forget that you will need a `tsconfig.json` file - [here is documentation where you can find examples](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

### 5. Set NFT Price and Supply

Now that we have our NFT, we need to set the start time, price, and supply. We can also set the number of NFTs that can be claimed in one transaction, create a white-list and adjust other settings. You can see a [full example here](/learn/code-examples/bundle-drop#setting-claim-conditions) (look at the 3rd example).

For our project, we are only going to set the start time, price, and supply. We can do this in a new file called `nftConfig.ts`. Start by importing our module and the necessary library.

```tsx
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import editionDrop from './getModule';
```

Then we create a function called `nftConfig` and add the code to adjust the config of our NFT. 

```tsx
const nftConfig = async () => {
  const claimConditions = [
    {
      startTime: new Date(),
      maxQuantity: 1000,
      price: 0.01,
    },
  ];
  try {
    await editionDrop.claimConditions.set('1', claimConditions); // 1 refers to token ID - the ID of our NFT
    console.log('🎉 Successfully added the claim condition!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Failed to set claim condition. Error: ', error);
  } 
};

nftConfig();
```

In your root directory, run the code with this command in your console: `npx ts-node scripts/nftConfig.ts`

And you should see the success message in your console:

![](/assets/portal/guides/early-access-nft-with-typescript/1-early-access-nft.png)

Amazing! We now have 1000 claimable NFTs! We just need a frontend for our users to interact with. Let's do it☺️

### 6. Display the NFT with a connect wallet button

We are going to display our NFT with a claim button to allow users to claim an NFT. We also have to offer a connect button for first-time users who have never connected their wallets to our site. 

To do this, we will work in the `src` folder in our React app.

Our first step is to create a file called `Nft.tsx` which will be our component used to display the NFT. 

We start off by installing the relevant library:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react
```

Then we can import the libraries we will need:

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useEditionDrop } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';
```


Create the `Nft` function and with a `useEffect` hook to fetch the NFT using the SDK and the token id (which is found in the dashboard) as a param:

```tsx
const Nft = () => {
  const editionDrop = useEditionDrop(
    '<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>'
  );
  const [nft, setNft] = useState('');

  async function fetchNft() {
    try {
      const nft = await editionDrop?.get('0');
      if (nft?.metadata.image) {
        setNft(nft?.metadata.image);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Failed to get NFT. Error: ', error);
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchNft();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div style={{ margin: '10vh' }}>
      <h1 style={{ fontSize: '28px', marginBottom: '10vh' }}>
        Claim your early access NFT!
      </h1>
      <img
        alt='early access nft'
        src={nft}
        width='250px'
        height='250px'
        style={{ marginBottom: '5vh' }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Nft;
```
### 7. Claim Button

Okay. We have our NFT displayed and all we need is a button for users to claim NFTs. Let's create a new component in a file called `ClaimButton.tsx`. 

First, we import the libraries:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useEditionDrop, useMetamask, useAddress } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';
```

We will use the `useMetamask` and `useAddress` thirdweb hooks to allow users to connect to their MetaMask wallets. We will check if the user is connected and if so, we will allow them to claim an NFT using the `claim` method with the token id and quantity as params.

```tsx
const ClaimButton = () => {
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();

  const editionDrop = useEditionDrop(
    '<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>'
  );

  const address = useAddress();
  
  // State to track when a user is claiming an NFT
  const [claiming, setClaiming] = useState(false);

  // Claim our NFT with the claim method - (token id, quantity)
  const onClick = async () => {
    setClaiming(true);
    try {
      await editionDrop?.claim(0, 1);
      alert('Successfully Claimed!');
      setClaiming(false);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Failed to claim. Error: ', error);
      setClaiming(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {address ? (
        <button
          disabled={claiming}
          style={{
            padding: '10px 20px',
            textAlign: 'center',
            backgroundColor: '#05A266',
            color: 'white',
          }}
          className='btn'
          onClick={onClick}
        >
          {claiming ? 'Claiming...' : 'Claim Early Access NFT'}
        </button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connectWithMetamask}>Connect MetaMask Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ClaimButton;
```
Don't forget to add your ClaimButton to your Nft component and your NFT component to your `App.tsx` so that everything is displayed as it should be.
