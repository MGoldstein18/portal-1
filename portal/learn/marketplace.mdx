The protocol provides a **Market** component - an open market for packs and NFTs of any kind. The protocol lets you create n number of **Market** components.

The **Market** component is a marketplace for buying and selling packs and NFTs, and works like any other popular NFT marketplaces e.g. [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). The **Market** lets you collect royalties, if any, on the secondary sales of tokens from your **Pack** and **NFT Collection** modules.

## Royalties and protocol fees

The protocol's market is designed to support the sale of any kind of NFTs - [ERC 1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) or [ERC 720](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) tokens - which includes tokens created using the **Pack** and **NFT Collection** modules. This allows the protocol to distribute perpetual royalty to you, whenever packs or NFTs are sold on the market.

The **Market** does not enforce that packs or NFTs created using the **Pack** and **NFT Collection** modules be sold on the protocol's dedicated **Market**.

For instance, packs and NFTs created using the **Pack** and **NFT Collection** modules can be sold on external marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) just like any other NFTs.

## Pricing packs and NFTs

The protocol's market for packs and NFTs is not an auction based market. Owners of packs or NFTs list their tokens on sale by specifying:

- The amount of tokens to list for sale. The seller must lock this amount of tokens in the market.
- The currency accepted by the listing. The market supports any [ERC 20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) currency.
- The price per token listed (to be paid in the stated currency).
- (Optional) A window of time within which the listing is active.

At any given time, a seller can choose to update any of these parameters. Updating these parameters is a transaction which requires the seller to pay the required gas fees.
