## Intro

With thirdweb you can mint NFT's, create drops and build your own marketplace. All of this is done inside Projects and Modules. In this guide we'll create a Project with the dashbaord. If you donâ€™t know what **Projects** and **Modules** are, then [click here.](/learn/introduction)

## Dashboard setup

### Create a Project

Head over to the [dashboard](/dashboard) and connect your wallet, select a network and create a project. We will be working on the Rinkeby test network in this guide.

When you go to the website, you should run in to the following landpage.

A pop-up will prompt, allowing you to chose a wallet.

After you clicked on the wallet of you choice, click on the account you want to log in the dashboard with.

In this guide, we will be using Rinkeby.

Good. You're all set-up! Now it's time to deploy your first smart contract.

Let's call our project TypeScript drop and click on 'Create'!

That is it! You have successfully created a project in thirdweb to which you can [add modules](/learn/modules).
