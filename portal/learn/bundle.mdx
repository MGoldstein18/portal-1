Further motivation behind adopting the ERC 1155 standard for NFTs can be found in the Motivation section of the official ERC 1155 standard write-up, [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#motivation).

The **Bundle** component is designed to work seamlessly with other popular token standards like like [ERC 721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) NFTs or [ERC 20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). Arbitrary crypto assets - NFTs or currencies - can be wrapped as ERC 1155 tokens, allowing for creative ways to bundle arbitrary crypto assets as NFTs in the **Bundle** component.
